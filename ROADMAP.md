Roadmap
=======

Here's the basic road map for developing the extension:

1. (done) Set up the extension and build basic template scaffolding.
1. Create the API calls for getting comments associated with a package (dummy data), and update the templates to use them.
1. Create the database tables to hold comments, and update the API to use them.
1. Create a form and a controller for adding basic comments. (This gets us to _Minimum Viable Product_ &mdash; the rest is icing.)
1. Integrate comments with CKAN's event/notification system.
1. Integrate comments with CKAN's search system.
1. Add comment threading and others bells/whistles. Maybe consider rolling comments up to groups and organisations. Let people rate comments as useful. etc. etc.
